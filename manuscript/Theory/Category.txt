## Zero System Perspecive

Zero System is an implementation of a software system that allows for manifestation of systems from declarations.

Declarations organize cores and implementation adapters to compose the system by declaring standards-based relationships between entities represending different arbitrary parts of the system.

Declarations are standards-based and these API contracts are isomorphic as long as they follow Category Theory Principles.


## Moment of Awareness: Sep 2015

I became aware of *Category Theory* on Sep 2, 2015. It explains many transformation principles I have been thinking about for a long time without having the words to explain them. My understanding of Category Theory is limited to intuition and it seems to be highly synergistic with my work.

A library that comes to mind that I found a couple of months ago that captures the ideas of Category Theory but did not mention Category Theory in a way that it registered with me [RxJS](https://github.com/Reactive-Extensions/RxJS).
