## Zero System Perspecive

Zero System is an ideal approach to drive construction and deployment to Unikernels as all dependencies can be clearly defined and reduced.

The key lies in developing domain models that transcend unikernel and container architectures. This transcendence is the focus of [PINF.Genesis](http://genesis.pinf.org).


## Moment of Re-Awareness: Sep 2015
