## Zero System

Zero System is ideally suited to model and drive schema-based distributed data architectures as it can compile source logic to any format required.

Because Zero System source logic is organized according to axioms that are present in all layers of logic and application we can guarantee to a large extent to be able to support any yet to be invented system.

This makes Zero System a perfect plact to keep data modeling source logic as it will be future-proof and finally allow data scientists to focus their attention on other topics.



## Moment of Awareness: Oct 2015

I was watching [this video](https://youtu.be/nG3yz1FsAxc) about [GunDB](http://gundb.io) and it finally confirmed to me that I am not missing anything in my approach to data modeling and persistence.

Of course I have been working with data and databases for a long time but I had never looked at all the concepts involved from a higher vantage point as I have been too focused on the development and runtime architecture of systems.

From my experience with system structures, GunDB is right on track with its philosophy and approach as it can be reduced to one [axiom](https://github.com/amark/gun/wiki/How-to-Create-GUN).
